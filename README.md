# LoopBack AngularJS SDK

This module is in Active LTS mode, new features are no longer accepted.
(See [Module Long Term Support Policy](#module-long-term-support-policy) below.)
LoopBack 3 users looking for new features are encouraged to upgrade to LoopBack 4. Refer to [loopback-next#1849](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/1849) for more information on how to upgrade.

**NOTE: The loopback-sdk-angular module supersedes [loopback-angular](https://www.npmjs.org/loopback-angular). Please update your package.json accordingly.**

The JavaScript AngularJS SDK provides an API based on
[ngResource.$resource](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource.$resource)
that enable your AngularJS app to access a
[LoopBack](http://loopback.io) server application.

The client is dynamic, in other words it automatically includes all the
LoopBack models and methods you've defined on your server.
You don't have to manually write any static code.

See the official [LoopBack AngularJS SDK
documentation](http://loopback.io/doc/en/lb3/AngularJS-JavaScript-SDK.html)
for more information.
